          Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
          education system, which falls under the command of the government at
          three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the
          Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          the total number of public schools to private schools in India is
          10:3.[7] Education in India covers different levels and types of
          learning, such as early childhood education, primary education,
          secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It
          varies significantly according to different factors, such as location
          (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.

          Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
          preceptor after initiation.[34] The education was delivered through
          Gurukula. The relationship between the Guru and his Shishya (students
          /disciples) was a very important part of education.[35] Takshasila (in
          modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning
          institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is
          debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern
          sense, since teachers living there may not have had official
          membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have
          existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a
          Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.
          Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in
          the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the
          Pali language.

          Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, that is both the
          Indian central government, and the state governments have
          responsibility for enacting and implementing education policy.[41] The
          central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2"
          pattern of education.[42]:3 In this pattern, study of 10 years is done
          in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges (Maharashtra) or Higher
          Secondary Schools(most other states),[42]: 44 and then 3 years of
          study for a bachelor's degree.[43] The first 10 years is further
          subdivided into 8 years of elementary education (5 years Primary
          School and 3 years Middle School), 2 years of Secondary education
          followed by 2 years of Higher Secondary Schools or Junior
          colleges.[42]:5 This pattern originated from the recommendation of the
          Education Commission of 1964-66.
